# Machine Learning

(!) = Definitely needs to be reworded or explained more

-Standardized CodeRabbit introduction

Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Data is becoming more easily available

-Data sets are becoming larger

-Both the private companies and government institutions are becoming better at
 generating, streaming, and storing data
 
-We need algorithms/models (!) that can help us gain insight from increasingly 
 large and complex datasets

-Machine Learning is a discipline that studies how computers can automatically 
 analyze and draw conclusions from data. (!)
  -*Even though technically it is a subfield of mathematics and does not 
   necessarily need to use computers.*

-Examples (I'll probably choose three):

  -Facebook and Snapchat use machine learning to build technology that can 
   recognize faces
   
  -Online advertisers use machine learning to offer you the products you are 
   most likely to buy
   
  -Large banks use machine learning to detect credit fraud
  
  -Self-Driving cars use machine learning to saftely navagate through roads.
  
  -Hedge Funds use machine learning to predict movements in the stock market.
  
  -Netflix uses machine learning to recommend movies and TV shows you might 
   like.

Body
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm actually not sure where to go with the body for the first video's transcript...

Options:
1. How these institutions getting more data?

  -Many free applications on both your browser and your phone are designed to
   record and store your data
   
    -retweets, likes, views, right swipes, your location, and even your tax 
     return information are all saved by these applications
     
  -Some companies store your credit card information, social security number,
   and spending history
   
    -This is why data breaches like those at Target and Experian are so
     dangerous (!)
     
   -Some countries have strong privacy laws that require companies to keep
    your data secure and anonymous (!), others do not
    
     -This is a very controversial issue
     
2. At the heart of any machine learning project is a model

  -There are two types of models:
  
    -Classification - We try to predict a category
    
      -Is an email important or spam?
      
      -Is this a picture of a cat or a dog?
      
    -Regression - We try to predict a number
    
      -How much does this house cost?
      
      -What is this person's credit score?
      
  -We can have algorithms generate these models for us
  
    -Models allow us to explain trends in our data or predict trends in the
     future
     
  -Most algorithms use calculus and matrix algebra to create models
  
    -luckily, most programming languages have libraries or packages that allow
     us to use these algorithms while the pre-packaged code deals with the
     heavy lifting in the background. (!)
     
Conclusion
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Machine Learning is pretty cool.
